      	    <p> We have just added our first HTML Meta tag! 
This Meta tag lets the browser know that we are using UTF-8 character encoding.  
UTF-8 is the most commonly used character encoding, basically it provides a standard format (encoding) for text (code) that will assist against the problems of endianness, which could result in incorrect or invalid characters displaying (http:// en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness). 
Tags inside the head element of a HTML document are often used to tell the browser information about the HTML document that we don't need to output as part of our content, such as our HTML title and character encoding.
